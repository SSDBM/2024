## Keynote 1: Angela Bonifati ([bio](https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/angela.bonifati/index.shtml))

**TITLE:** Managing Constraints and Transformations in Property Graphs.

**ABSTRACT:** Property graphs are widely known as an expressive data model for representing interconnected multi-labeled data enhanced with properties as key/value pairs. They are used in a wide range of domains, such as social and transportation networks, biological networks, finance, cybersecurity, logistics and planning, to name a few. Property graphs are the building blocks of future graph ecosystems, in which OLTP and OLAP processes are intertwined with complex advanced processes, such as learning, scientific computing and business intelligence. 
While property graphs are currently used in a variety of graph databases, a rather fragmented landscape emerges in terms of the supported query and schema languages. In particular, the coverage of schema and constraints is limited if not completely lacking in these systems. In this talk, I will present recent advances in terms of schemas and constraints for property graphs, as part of our work within the LDBC community groups. I will also focus on property graph transformations leveraging graph pattern calculus abstractions and leading to a declarative framework having practical utility and efficiency. 
Finally, I will pinpoint future directions of research in this new exciting area of data management.

## Keynote 2: Pierre Hellier ([bio](https://people.irisa.fr/Pierre.Hellier/))

**TITLE:** Learned image and video compression

**ABSTRACT:** Image and video compression continues to be a relevant scientific and technological concern with the continuous growth of video streaming.Recent statistics indicate that streaming accounts for more than 75% of the internet traffic. 
In this talk, I will first briefly recall the principles of classical compression methods, their current limits and the standardization landscape. Then, I will discuss how machine learning brings new methods and capabilities for compression. In particular, ML offers possibilities for semantic compression, as well as new paradigms based on implicit representations.

**BIO:** After an engineering diploma in aeronautics (Ensae-SupAero) and a MsC in applied mathematics obtained at Toulouse university, Dr. Hellier received his PhD on medical image registration in 2000. He moved as a postdoctoral researcher to Utrecht university. He was appointed INRIA researcher in 2001. From 2001 to 2011, He focused on computer vision methods for medical image registration, image-guided neurosurgery and transcranial magnetic stimulation. He was a visiting professor at McGill university, Montreal in 2006. In 2009, Dr. Hellier co-founded a startup to industrialize a neuronavigation system for transcranial magnetic stimulation, and served as scientific council. So far, the neuronavigation system has been used in 30+ hospitals on 10k+ patients.
In 2011, he moved to Technicolor research, working on UGC content synchronization, enhancement, and professional post-production: film grain, color grading, color restoration, unsharp masking and mosaicing. He pursued at InterDigital research in 2019, focusing on machine learning for image and video compression, as well as deep learning for digital human modeling.
Since 2024, He is with the university of Rennes, junior professor chair.

## Keynote 3: John Wu ([bio](https://profiles.lbl.gov/20161-john-wu/))

**TITLE:** Bridging the Data Divide: Distributed Workflow Management for the Next Generation of Scientific Research.

**ABSTRACT:** Modern scientific experiments and simulations generate data at an
unprecedented scale, demanding powerful, yet often geographically distant,
high-performance computing (HPC) resources for analysis.  This fundamental
challenge necessitates innovative data management and workflow systems that
can seamlessly bridge the gap between distributed instruments and computing
power.  This presentation explores the pressing need for integrated
data-centric ecosystems in science.  We examine key application drivers and
survey cutting-edge scientific data management and workflow systems,
highlighting practical examples and emerging technologies.  By connecting
experimental facilities with HPC through efficient data services, we can
unlock the full potential of scientific data, accelerating the pace of
discovery and ushering in a new era of data-driven science.

**BIO:** Dr. Kesheng (John) Wu is a visionary leader in advanced technology research
and development at Scientific Networking Division of Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory, leading a team at the forefront of scientific data
management and workflow management.  His work focuses on accelerating
research breakthroughs by seamlessly integrating distributed scientific
facilities with high-performance computing resources.  Dr. Wu's team
develops innovative solutions for data-intensive scientific workflows,
including in-network storage and computation, optimized network operations,
and cutting-edge testbeds involving both conventional optical networking and
quantum communication capabilities.  These testbeds provide a crucial
platform for the broader research community to explore and shape the future
of networking technology.

## Keynote 4: Patrick Valduriez ([bio](https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Patrick.Valduriez/))

**TITLE:** Data Science and Innovation.

**ABSTRACT:** Data science and innovation have become overloaded terms, leading to some confusion. To be successful, the innovation process involves not only inventions (e.g., new methods) but also context, e.g., user behavior, and timing, e.g., market readiness. In this talk, I discuss the impact of data science on innovation, using selected success stories (some of which I was involved in). I also give hints to promote innovation within companies, in particular, using open innovation. Finally, I describe some innovations in the context of the Inria-Brasil partnership.
